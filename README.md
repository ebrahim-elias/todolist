# todolist
This is App for todo List
* Your task is to build a Todo list Application.
* The application allows a user to create new tasks,
* assign them a title and due date, and choose a project for that task to belong to.
* using a text based user interface via the command-line.
* Once they are using the application, the user is able to edit, mark as done or remove tasks.
* They can also quit and save the current task list to file,
* and then restart the application with the former state restored.
